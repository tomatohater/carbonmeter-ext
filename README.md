# Carbon Meter (web browser extension)

*Track carbon emissions resulting from your daily web browsing.*

## Why?

The web is a big consumer of energy and today most of that energy comes from the burning of fossil fuels. On average, a single page view generates 1.76g<sup>1</sup> of carbon emissions or equivalent greenhouse gases.

This extension keeps track of the estimated carbon emitted (based on averages) while you are browsing around the web. Watch how quickly it all adds up!

<sup>1</sup> Average carbon emissions per page view according to [Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com/) as of March 24, 2021.


## Acknowledgement

This extension was inspired when [Dryden Williams](https://www.drydenwilliams.co.uk/) recently posed the following 2 questions to the [ClimateAction.tech](https://climateaction.tech/) community.

> How many web pages do I visit per day?
>
> And how much CO2 per year this accounts for? (it's in tonnes)
